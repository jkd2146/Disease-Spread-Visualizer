# New York City Air Pollution

There are two parts to this code-

1. When running project1.py- the user will be prompted with options to use as reference when retrieving data.

2. When running project2.py- It shows an example of the practicality of the code when performing data analysis with the questions I had set up.

I recommend using part 1, as reference when trying to recreate this project and then using part 2 to see how to implement it when analyzing data.
